## About Me

Hi there! My name is Joseph Olayanju, and I'm a Node.js developer. I have experience working with technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Git, and JavaScript.

I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills as a developer. Currently, I'm focused on improving my understanding of data structures and algorithms through self-study.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to check out my repositories to see some of my past projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on recently:

- [Shopping API](https://github.com/olayanju-1234/shopping) - An e-commerce api built with Node.js.
- [CLI](https://github.com/olayanju-1234/cli) - olayanju-joe-cli is a Node.js CLI app that automates the generation of Now configuration for web applications.
- [MyBook](https://github.com/olayanju-1234/mybook) - Mybook is a Node.js and Express.js web app with MongoDB, including OAuth authentication and CRUD functionality for user-generated content.
